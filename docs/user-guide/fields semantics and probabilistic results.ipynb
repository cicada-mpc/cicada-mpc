    "While working with the Cicada library, it is important to keep in mind that the values you see and work with which often go through the steps of encoding and decoding do not actually exist when they are being manipulated in a series of secret shared operations. Our fixed-point arithmetic system is a mapping of a finite number of elements with fixed binary precision onto a finite number of elements which are simply a set of integers modulo some prime large enough to accommodate the range of interest. To see this directly, inspect the encoding and decoding functions for yourself. A link is given here for convenience: \n",

    "The functions do assume that the encoder has already been instantiated and its parameters defined such as scale which is simply 2^precision where precision is the number of fractional bits, or the number of bits to the right of the radix point. Any fractional precision requiring more bits to represent present in the value to be encoded will be lost via the encoding process. Also note that if a value is negative it will fall into the upper half of the field due to the application of the modulus. This is made more explicit by the decoding function which relies on some additional variables which are assigned at the time of the encoder’s instantiation, specifically, “posbound” which is equal to the floor of the prime modulus halved. Posbound is the threshold in the field over which a value will be interpreted as negative. Thus, the field is split into two regions the upper half of the field is dedicated to representing negative numbers while the lower half of the field represents positive numbers. Let's go ahead an instantiate a small one for examples. \n"

    "Let us consider an 8 bit field. The largest 8 bit prime is $251=2^8-5$. That indicates that posbound will be 125, meaning all values in the range [126,250] will be interpreted as negative. In our example encoder we’ll have 3 bits of fractional precision. This means the scale used in encoding and decoding will be $2^3=8$. Notice the arguments given to the protocol constructor below, especially the 251 for the modulus to be used for the encoder, and the 3 to be used for the fractional part bitwidth."

    "These issues have a few follow on implications. The first is that overflow and underflow can and will happen without any notice if code is not written carefully since all the operations occur obliviously. Take care that the operations are applied to operands with no or very small chance of this happening. It may happen in unexpected situations and yield similarly unexpected results. For example, the addition of two positive values may yield a negative seemingly non-sensical result if their sum puts them into the upper half of the field which will later be decoded as a negative value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, division is not directly possible in the context of the field since it is an integral field no notion of values less than one exists in that context. We use field elements to represent fractional values, but these are somewhat bootstrapped on semantics that have no significance to the field itself. We can get a stable and expected result of division by multiplying by an elements multiplicative inverse in the context of the field, but this has the desired result iff the intended dividend has the desired divisor as a factor. Otherwise the result will not yield any useful value for the external semantics. In general, we perform division via approximation, masking, and the like. The accuracy of the result from any division operation is heavily dependent on the precision available from the encoder with respect to the number of bits right of the radix.  \n",

For example, consider the approach we have implemented for truncation. The function masks a shared secret with a random field element. It is possible that the sum of the operand and the random field element will overflow the field, which would cause the whole process to be wildly inaccurate. This is very unliekly to happen in practice however if the operands are relatively small in comparison to the size of the field. Additionally, a small error (overflow in the least significant bits generated from a carry coming into this region from the bits that were truncated) is also a possibility.

    "We define an interactive Cicada program as one that prompts a human for secret input to be used in a computation.  Because handling secret interactive input can be tricky, Cicada includes the :func:`cicada.interactive.secret_input` function, which prompts one player for input from a console, which could then be secret-shared with the group.  You can use it for simple demos and as a starting-point for more sophisticated interaction.  Here are some examples:\n",

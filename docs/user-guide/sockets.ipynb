    "Socket Communication\n",
    "====================\n",
    "\n",
    "As you've seen elsewhere in this documentation, the Cicada :any:`Communicator` interface defines a set of :ref:`communication-patterns` that can be used by algorithms, with :any:`SocketCommunicator` providing an implementation that uses standard operating system sockets and TCP/IP networking for the transport layer.  While advanced users with specialized hardware may wish to write their own communicators from scratch, there is much more to :any:`SocketCommunicator` than you've seen so far; this article will introduce you to the full generality and flexibility of socket communication in Cicada.\n",
    "\n",
    "SocketCommunicator Creation\n",
    "---------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin, you may-or-may-not have noticed it, but none of the examples in this documentation create an instance of the :any:`SocketCommunicator` class directly - in some cases the communicator is created implicitly as part of another call (:any:`SocketCommunicator.run`), and in others a factory function returns a new communicator, ready for use (:any:`SocketCommunicator.connect`, :any:`SocketCommunicator.split`).  This is because an instance of :any:`SocketCommunicator` doesn't just wrap a single socket, it wraps a collection of sockets, allowing every player to communicate directly with every other player.  Creating those sockets and setting-up the connections is a complex process involving careful coordination among players, which is why Cicada divides :any:`SocketCommunicator` creation into separate high-level and low-level APIs.  The low-level APIs are used to create and initialize socket connections that are passed to a new instance of :any:`SocketCommunicator` when the latter is created as part of the high-level API.\n",
    "\n",
    "High Level API\n",
    "--------------\n",
    "\n",
    "The high level API provides the following methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "**SocketCommunicator.run**\n",
    "\n",
    ":any:`SocketCommunicator.run` is a static method that creates a set of player processes on the local machine, each executing a function that you provide.  Before your function is executed, sockets are initialized using the low-level API, and :any:`SocketCommunicator` instances are created and passed as the first argument to your function.  This method is widely used for development, debugging, and the examples in this documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**SocketCommunicator.connect**\n",
    "\n",
    ":any:`SocketCommunicator.connect` is a static factory function that creates sockets using the low level API, returning a new instance of :any:`SocketCommunicator`.  It must be called by every player that will be included in the new communicator.  The sockets are initialized using either parameters you provide, or environment variables set by the :ref:`cicada` `run` and :ref:`cicada` `start` commands.  This is a good choice for running your programs in production on separate hosts.  See :ref:`running-programs` for examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that you can call :any:`SocketCommunicator.connect` more than once within a program to create multiple communicators, which is more flexible (but less convenient) than using :any:`SocketCommunicator.split`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**SocketCommunicator.split**\n",
    "\n",
    ":any:`SocketCommunicator.split` partitions an existing communicator's players into groups, and returns a new instance of :any:`SocketCommunicator` for the group containing the calling player.  It's a good choice when you need to split a group of players into smaller subgroups to work on separate tasks, and it must be called by every member of the existing communicator.  See :ref:`multiple-communicators` for examples. \n",
    "\n",
    "**SocketCommunicator.shrink**\n",
    "\n",
    ":any:`SocketCommunicator.shrink` is intended for use when failures have occurred - it returns a new instance of :any:`SocketCommunicator` that contains the subset of players that are still alive and responding.  It should be called by as many remaining members of the existing communicator as possible.  Note that :any:`SocketCommunicator.shrink` cannot guarantee that all remaining players will be included in the new communicator, so you would likely never want to use it outside of failure recovery situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Low Level API\n",
    "-------------\n",
    "\n",
    "The low level API is located in the :mod:`cicada.communicator.socket.connect` module, and includes the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Timer**\n",
    "\n",
    "The :class:`~cicada.communicator.socket.connect.Timer` class is used to manage timeouts during initialization.  Callers typically create one instance of :class:`~cicada.communicator.socket.connect.Timer` and pass it the other low level API functions, to specify an overall timeout for the entire process.\n",
    "\n",
    "**listen**\n",
    "\n",
    "The :func:`~cicada.communicator.socket.connect.listen` function provides a standardized way to create a listening (server) socket, ready and waiting to accept connections.  Since :any:`SocketCommunicator` depends on connections between every pair of players, every player must create a listening socket in order to setup the network.  Typically, the listening socket is passed to :func:`~cicada.communicator.socket.connect.direct` or :func:`~cicada.communicator.socket.connect.rendezvous` and discarded. \n",
    "\n",
    "**direct**\n",
    "\n",
    "The :func:`~cicada.communicator.socket.connect.direct` function is used to create the complete network of connected sockets required to create an instance of :any:`SocketCommunicator`, when you know the address of every player in advance.  It must be called by every player that will become a member of the new communicator.  This is useful in managed or datacenter environments where addresses and port numbers can be specified up-front, which greatly simplifies and streamlines the setup process.\n",
    "\n",
    "**rendezvous**\n",
    "\n",
    "The :func:`~cicada.communicator.socket.connect.rendezvous` function is used to create the complete network of connected sockets required to create an instance of :any:`SocketCommunicator`, when only the address of the root (rank 0) player is known in advance. It must be called by every player that will become a member of the new communicator. This is more convenient when setting-up a group of players in an ad-hoc environment, but requires more time and provides more points for failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several other helper functions and classes in :mod:`cicada.communicator.socket.connect` that will not be covered here.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Addressing\n",
    "----------\n",
    "\n",
    "Network addresses throughout the low-level and high-level APIs must be specified as string URLs.  The use of URLs makes the choice of address family unambiguous, and allows for possible future expansion.  Currently, two types of address family are supported.  For TCP/IP networking, you can use the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* tcp\\://{ip address}:{port}\n",
    "* tcp\\://{ip address}\n",
    "\n",
    "In the latter case, a port number will be chosen at random.  Note that the API may not allow you to use the second form, depending on context - for example, :func:`~cicada.communicator.socket.connect.direct` does not allow any port-less addresses, while :func:`~cicada.communicator.socket.connect.rendezvous` allows addresses without ports for every player except rank 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you can use Unix domain sockets for connections between players running on the same machine.  To do so, use URLs like the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* file\\://{path}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Transport Layer Security (TLS/SSL)\n",
    "----------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Cicada's socket communicator infrastructure supports Transport Layer Security (formerly: Secure Sockets Layer) for encrypted communication links and player identification.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Custom Initialization\n",

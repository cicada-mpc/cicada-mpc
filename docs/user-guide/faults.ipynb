    "Fault Detection and Recovery\n",
    "============================\n",
    "\n",
    "One of Cicada's most distinguishing features is that it supports fault tolerance at the application level: put simply, Cicada raises exceptions when failures occur, where most MPC tools simply stop executing.  This allows Cicada MPC programs to keep running, react to failures, and continue computation.  Of course, there are many possible ways that an application can react to a failure, and many engineering tradeoffs involved in developing a fault tolerance strategy, which is why Cicada leaves it to the application developer to decide which approach is appropriate.  We don't want to suggest that designing for fault recovery is easy, but Cicada provides a solid set of tools to implement a fault recovery policy.\n",

This behavior (communicator methods that raise exceptions) is the primary mechanism that Cicada uses to notify the application when a fault has occurred.

The information that a failure has occurred must reach you somehow, either explicitly because some other process informed you that the player failed, or implicitly because you didn't hear from the other player within a set period of time.

But how can we call methods like :meth:`~cicada.shamir.ShamirBasicProtocolSuite.reveal` using just a subset of the original four players?

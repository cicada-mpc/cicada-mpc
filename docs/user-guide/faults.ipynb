    "Fault Detection and Recovery\n",
    "============================\n",
    "\n",
    "One of Cicada's most distinguishing features is that it supports fault tolerance at the application level: put simply, Cicada raises exceptions when failures occur, where most MPC tools simply stop executing.  This allows Cicada MPC programs to keep running, react to failures, and continue computation.  Of course, there are many possible ways that an application can react to a failure, and many engineering tradeoffs involved in developing a fault tolerance strategy, which is why Cicada leaves it to the application developer to decide which approach is appropriate.  We don't want to suggest that designing for fault recovery is easy, but Cicada provides a solid set of tools to implement a fault recovery policy.\n",

This behavior (communicator methods that raise exceptions) is the main mechanism that Cicada uses to notify the application when a fault has occurred.  To create a fault-tolerant application, you must be prepared to handle exceptions **any time you implicitly or explicitly use a communicator**.\n",

Imagine that you are a player process: how can you know that a process on another host has failed?  The information that a failure has occurred must reach you somehow, either explicitly when some other process informs you that the player has failed, or implicitly when you haven't heard from the other player within a set period of time. Either approach implies communication, which is why fault detection is so firmly tied to communicators.\n",

Fortunately, it isn't - because we used :ref:`shamir` with a total of 3 players and a threshold of 2, we should be able to recover the secret with our two remaining players.

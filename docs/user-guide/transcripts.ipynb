We refer to these more detailed logs as *transcripts*, and generate them using the :mod:`cicada.transcript` module. Transcripts supplement Cicada's normal logging with an optional recording mechanism that generates new categories of log messages, and a set of :mod:`logging` components to filter and format those messages in straightforward ways. \n",

    "So, that worked perfectly. Let's consider some other options you can use when working with code outputs. First, you can choose to have network messages interleaved with the code, using `sent=True` and `received=True`, which behave similarly to what we saw earlier with :func:`~cicada.transcript.net_handler`. Let's try turning them on. We'll also go back to sending the transcript directly to the screen, but this time we'll use a :class:`~logging.NullHandler` to disable the output for every player except player 0:"

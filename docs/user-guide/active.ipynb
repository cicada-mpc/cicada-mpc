    "------------------\n",
    "\n",
    ":class:`Additive secret sharing <cicada.additive.AdditiveProtocolSuite>` and :ref:`Shamir secret sharing <shamir>` are popular sharing schemes provided by Cicada, but are secure only against semi-honest (also known as \"honest but curious\") adversaries. With this security model, private information is secure against disclosure, but a malicious player (an \"active adversary\") could deliberately alter a calculation to produce an invalid result, and none of the other players would know.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a more robust (but slower) alternative, Cicada provides :class:`~cicada.active.ActiveProtocolSuite`, which provides honest majority security with abort. In this case, private information is still secure against disclosure, *and* tampering with a calculation can be detected by an honest player, so long as there are less than :math:`\\frac{n}{2}` dishonest players.\n",
    "\n",
    ":class:`~cicada.active.ActiveProtocolSuite` supports the same mathematical and logical operations as :class:`~cicada.additive.AdditiveProtocolSuite` and :class:`~cicada.shamir.ShamirProtocolSuite`, and its secret shares are implemented using a combination of additive and Shamir secret sharing.  The security against malicious alteration in this case is derived from the fact that attempts to alter both types of share in parallel give rise to inconsistencies that can be detected.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the *identity* of dishonest players may not be detectable by this scheme, nor is there any way to recover a correct value from the computation - the only resort for honest players is to discontinue the computation (abort) and restart it with a different (hopefully honest) group of players.\n",

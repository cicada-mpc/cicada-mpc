    "As one alternative to :class:`additive secret sharing <cicada.additive.AdditiveProtocolSuite>`, Cicada provides Shamir sharing, which supports the same set of mathematical and logical operations. Unlike additive sharing, Shamir's is a threshold scheme such that for any set of :math:`n` players, a threshold :math:`k` can be specified where any subset of :math:`n >= k` can reveal a secret.  To accomplish this, Shamir's scheme is based on creating and evaluating polynomials over an integral field.  To share a secret :math:`s` among :math:`n` parties with threshold :math:`k`, a random polynomial with the following form is generated over the field :math:`\\mathbb{Z}_p`, where the :math:`c` coefficients are all random field elements: \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "After construction of the polynomial, the :math:`c` coefficients become the shares that are distributed among players. Reconstruction of the secret is accomplished with straightforward Lagrange interpolation. In the following, :math:`x` and :math:`y` with subscripts have their usual meaning in the context of successive points at which a polynomial is evaluated and the result of that evaluation respectively, and the subscripts denote the position of each within a list of such pairs:\n",

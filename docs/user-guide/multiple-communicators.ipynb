    "A Cicada communicator represents a group of players who have agreed to work on a problem together; importantly, the number of players in a communicator is set when the communicator is created, and never changes. This is usually what you want, but for more complex computations, and in situations where you need the number of players to change over time, you can work with multiple communicators in a single program.\n",

    "One way to to do this is the :meth:`~cicada.communicator.socket.SocketCommunicator.split` method, which can be used to create one-or-more new communicators from an existing communicator.  First, let's look at the name and list of players in a \"parent\" communicator:"

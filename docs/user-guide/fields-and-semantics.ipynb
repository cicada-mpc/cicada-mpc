    "The mapping from fractional values to positive integers in the field have many follow-on implications. The first is that overflow and underflow can and will happen without any notice if code is not written with the field size in mind, since all operations occur obliviously.  This may happen in unexpected situations and yield similarly unexpected results. For example, the addition of two positive values may yield a negative seemingly non-sensical result if their sum puts them into the upper half of the field which will later be decoded as a negative value.  Ensure that field sizes are large enough to make this impossible (or at least unlikely). \n",

We use field elements to represent fractional values, but these are semantics that have no significance to the field itself. We can get a stable and expected result for division by multiplying with an element's multiplicative inverse in the context of the field, but this has the desired result if-and-only-if the intended dividend has the desired divisor as a factor. Otherwise the result will not yield any useful value for the external semantics. In general, we perform division via approximation, masking, and the like. The accuracy of the result from any division operation is heavily dependent on the precision available from the encoder with respect to the number of bits right of the radix.  \n",

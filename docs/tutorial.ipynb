    "The Millionaires' Dilemma\n",
    "-------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a pair of millionaires [*]_ who want to settle a bet over whose fortune is larger, yet neither wants to reveal the size of their fortune to the other, and neither is willing to reveal it to a third party. These may seem like mutually-exclusive goals, yet it turns out that we *can* arrive at a correct answer without revealing the size of either fortune.  Using secure multiparty computation (MPC), the millionaires can cooperatively compute which fortune is larger in such a way that both learn the result, yet neither learns the other's private information. \n",
    "\n",
    "Cicada provides a collection of components that can be combined in flexible ways to create MPC programs.  This tutorial will introduce you to the basic building blocks of a Cicada program, and solve the millionaires' dilemma.  Ready?  Let's get started!\n",

    "The Basics\n",
    "----------\n",
    "\n",
    "An important point to understand fully is that - just as the name says - secure multiparty computation involves multiple cooperating parties, which we will refer to as *players* throughout this documentation. In computer science terms, each player is a separate *process*, typically running on a separate *host*. In other words, you should think of an MPC program as a single set of instructions that run in parallel across multiple computers, communicating and coordinating as they execute.\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing programs this way can feel a little weird until you become accustomed to it.  Fortunately, the high performance computing (HPC) community has been writing programs this way for decades, and Cicada brings that expertise to MPC.  If you're familiar with writing software using popular HPC tools like `MPI <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_Passing_Interface>`_, you'll be right at home in Cicada.  If not, don't worry!  We'll explain how it all works as we go. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before we begin, let's setup Python's builtin logging functionality, which Cicada uses to provide feedback from running MPC programs:"

For this tutorial we're going to focus on *additive secret sharing*, where the shares of a secret are randomly-chosen numbers that reveal the secret value when summed. Thus, a player can only learn (or reveal) the value of a secret if they have access to every share, in order to add them all together.\n",

We do this often to keep our examples succinct. Whenever you see examples that embed literal secrets into code, you should keep in mind that a \"real\" program with \"real\" secrets would supply them in a privacy-preserving way, by loading data from a player-specific file or database, reading a sensor that only that player has access to, prompting a human to enter a value on a secure terminal, or similar.\n",

Remember that every player is running the code in parallel - :any:`AdditiveProtocolSuite.share` is an example of a *collective operation*, one that **must** be called by every player and, except for the values of the `secret` argument, must be called with the same arguments by every player.  This is a common pattern throughout Cicada (and MPI, if you're familiar with HPC programming).  In this case, the arguments indicate that the actual secret value will be provided by player 0 (`src=0`), and that the secret is a scalar value (`shape=()` ... remember that Cicada can work with arrays of any shape as secrets).  Every player has to provide *some* value for `secret` because the Python language  requires it, but only the value provided by the player matching `src` matters.\n",

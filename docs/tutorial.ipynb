    "The Millionaires' Dilemma\n",
    "-------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a pair of millionaires who want to know which has the biggest fortune, but don't want to reveal the exact size of their fortune to the other. This may seem like an impossible task, yet it turns out that we can arrive at the correct answer without revealing either of the millionaires' secrets.  Using secure multiparty computation (MPC), the millionaires can cooperatively compute which fortune is largest in such a way that both learn the result, yet neither learns the other's private information. \n",
    "\n",
    "Cicada provides a collection of components that can be combined in flexible ways to create MPC programs.  This tutorial will introduce you to the basic building blocks of a Cicada program, and solve the millionaires' dilemma.  Ready?  Let's get started!\n",
    "\n",
    "The Basics\n",
    "----------\n",
    "\n",
    "An important point to understand fully is that - just as the name says - secure multiparty computation involves multiple cooperating parties, which we will refer to as *players* throughout this documentation. In computer science terms, each player is a separate *process*, typically running on a separate *host*. In other words, you should think of an MPC program as a single set of instructions that run in parallel across multiple computers, communicating and coordinating as they execute.\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing programs this way can feel a little weird until you become accustomed to it.  Fortunately, the high performance computing (HPC) community has been writing programs this way for decades, and Cicada brings that expertise to MPC.  If you're familiar with writing software using popular HPC tools like `MPI <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_Passing_Interface>`_, you'll be right at home in Cicada.  If not, don't worry!  We'll explain how it all works as we go. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before we begin, we'll setup Python's builtin logging functionality, since Cicada uses it to provide feedback when our programs run:"

    "Next, we need to setup two players. That means we're going to have to start two processes, each running the same program, and the processes will need to communicate with each other.  In Cicada, all communication is handled through *communicators*, which coordinate and pass messages between players.\n",

This is because the default 16 bits of precision used by FixedFieldEncoder to represent fractions can only approximate some values (of course, the original value was also a finite approximation of $\\pi$, so this shouldn't bother you too much).  For many computations 16 bits of fractional precision is more than enough, but if you need more (or less) precision, you can create an encoder with custom parameters.  For example, if we double the number of fractional bits:"

    "\n",
    "OK, with the preliminaries out of the way, let's do some MPC!  Recall that we have two players (the millionaires), that each has a secret (their fortune), and they wish to identify which secret is the largest, but without revealing the secrets to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key technique provided by MPC to accomplish this is *secret sharing*, where each secret is split into pieces called *secret shares*, and the shares are distributed to the other players.  Because MPC provides *protocols* that allow players to collaboratively perform mathematical operations on shares, and because it is provably impossible to reconstruct a secret unless a player has obtained all of the necessary shares, the players in our computation can perform arithmetic and logical operations on values without knowing what they are!\n",
    "\n",
    "There is more than one way to generate secret shares, and there are many protocols that have been developed to manipulate them.  As a simple starting exercise, we are going to focus on *additive secret sharing*, where the shares of a secret are randomly-chosen numbers that reveal the secret value when summed. Thus, a player can only learn (or reveal) the value of a secret if they have access to every share, in order to sum them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see what this looks like in Cicada.  To create and manipulate additive secret shares, we will create an instance of :any:`AdditiveProtocol`.  In the following example, we create the protocol, and use it to create a set of secret shares that are distributed to all players:"

This is a common pattern in Cicada (and MPI, if you're familiar with HPC programming).  In this case, the arguments indicate that player 0 will provide the secret (`src=0`), and that the secret is a scalar value (`shape=()` ... remember that Cicada can work with arrays of any shape as secrets).  Note that the secret is encoded using an encoder provided by the protocol.  The protocol object takes the encoded secret provided by player 0, creates secret shares, and distributes them to all players, where they become the return value from :any:`AdditiveProtocol.share`.

That's certainly true in this case, where all four players are running on the same machine.  Just keep in mind that to be truly secure, an MPC program needs to be run by  individual players on individual machines *that only those players control* - which is the only way to guarantee that those secrets remain truly private."

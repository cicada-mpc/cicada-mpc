# CICADA

This work provides an API for secure multi-party computation with unique features including integration with multiple networking technologies, and support for failure detection and recovery.  The title is a nod to <b>C</b>ooperat<b>I</b>ve <b>C</b>omputing for <b>A</b>utonomous <b>DA</b>ta centers.  Unlike existing work intended for large datacenters and static infrastructure, CICADA is distinguished by a need to address two key challenges:

* Works with low powered systems with lower reliability in communication.
* Resilience to unreliable communication links and participant failures.

class Logger(object):
    """Wrap a normal Python logger with a Cicada communicator to synchronize player output.

    Note
    ----
    Because :class:`Logger` communicates among players for synchronization, it
    can have a significant effect on performance, even when log messages are
    discarded by log levels or other filtering.

    Furthermore, :class:`Logger` should not be used in error recovery code, since it will
    fail attempting to communicate with players that are (presumably) dead.

    Parameters
    ----------
    logger: :class:`logging.Logger`, required.
        The Python logger to be used for output.
    communicator: :class:`cicada.communicator.interface.Communicator`, required
        The communicator that will be used to synchronize output among players.
    sync: :class:`bool`, optional
        Controls whether log output is synchronized among players.  In general,
        you should enable synchronization (the default) when multiple players
        are logging to the same console, for example during local debugging and
        regression tests.
